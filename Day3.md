# AWS: Cross Account Access & S3

## Overview
This session focused on understanding how AWS enables secure resource sharing between accounts and how to store and manage data using Amazon S3.

---

## Topics Covered
- Cross Account Access using IAM Roles  
- Amazon S3 fundamentals  

---

## Key Concepts

### Cross Account Access
Cross Account Access allows one AWS account to access resources in another account securely.

It is implemented using:
- IAM Roles  
- Trust Policies  

**Important Insight:**  
Access is granted temporarily through roles. No passwords or long-term credentials are shared.

---

### Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Amazon S3 is a scalable object storage service used to store and retrieve data from the cloud.

**Practical Work:**
- Created S3 buckets  
- Configured bucket permissions  
- Applied basic access control policies  

**Important Insight:**  
S3 provides reliable and secure storage with flexible access management.

## Real-World Application
In production environments:
- One AWS account stores data (e.g., in S3)  
- Another account accesses that data through IAM Roles  
- Access is controlled, temporary, and auditable  

This approach improves both **security** and **scalability**.

## Progress

Day 1 – Completed  
Day 2 – Completed  
Day 3 – Completed  

Consistency matters more than perfection.

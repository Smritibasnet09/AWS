# AWS Load Balancing & Auto Scaling 

---

# 🌐 1. Load Balancing

## 🔹 What is Load Balancing?

Load Balancing is a technique used to **distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers (EC2 instances)** so that no single server becomes overloaded.

👉 In simple terms:  
If many users access an application at the same time, instead of sending all requests to one server, AWS distributes them across multiple servers.

### ✅ Why we use Load Balancing:
- Improves performance  
- Ensures high availability  
- Prevents server overload  
- Provides fault tolerance
